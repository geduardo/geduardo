### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working at IWF (ETH ZÃ¼rich) trying to apply AI to learn more about the complex physical process behind the electric discharges in EDM.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: C++ and Arduino (perks of stepping into the engineering world with a theoretical physics background)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that is fun. I particularly like to smash games using AI bots.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a presonal project I'm trying to start. It consist in creating a open-source environment for artificial agents that do science. If you are interested please reach out to me to my [email](eduardo.gonzalez.sanchez07@gmail.com).
